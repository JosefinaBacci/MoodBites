## üöÄ Getting Started

###‚ö†Ô∏è Important (Must Read)

As this is an early version of the app and time constraints limited the implementation of a full authentication flow, the current **sign-up process** is manual.

To register:

1. Fill in the required information in the **email** and **password** input fields.
2. Then press the **"Sign Up"** button located at the bottom of the screen.

Once signed up, your session will be created, and you can start using the app.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: there is **no error handling or UI feedback** yet if the sign-up fails (e.g., due to an invalid email or weak password), so make sure to enter valid credentials.

Future versions will include proper sign up view, form validation, and user feedback.
